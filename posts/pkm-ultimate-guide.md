#### **Capture: Beyond Clipping**
The art of capturing information with intent. We'll cover tools and techniques for mindful collection, not just digital hoarding.

#### **Organize: Frameworks are Everything**
This is where the magic begins. We'll set the stage for the great frameworks that provide structure to your knowledge.

#### **Synthesize: From Notes to Insights**
The real goal of PKM. Learn how to connect ideas, identify patterns, and generate original thoughts from the notes you've gathered.

#### **Express: Knowledge in Action**
Using your structured knowledge to create, decide, and act with confidence. This is how your second brain pays dividends.

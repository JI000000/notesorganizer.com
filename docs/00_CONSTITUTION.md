# Project Constitution & Guiding Principles

This document outlines the core principles that guide the development of `notesorganizer.com` and the future `KortexAI.app`. Every feature, design choice, and piece of content should be measured against these principles.

## 1. Empower the User, Don't Replace Them

Our tools are designed to augment, not automate, the user's thinking process. AI should be a co-pilot, handling the tedious work of organizing and surfacing information, so the user can focus on the creative work of synthesis and insight generation. The user's mind is always the primary processor.

## 2. Champion Data Sovereignty

A user's knowledge is their most valuable digital asset. We will always prioritize local-first solutions and give users complete ownership and control over their data. Our flagship product will work on top of the user's local files, not by locking them into a proprietary cloud.

## 3. Simplicity through Power

True sophistication is making the complex feel simple. Our UI/UX philosophy is to hide complexity and provide a clean, intuitive interface that delivers powerful results without overwhelming the user.

## 4. Build a Community of Thinkers

Our success is not measured in sign-ups, but in the quality of the community we cultivate. We are building for serious thinkers, knowledge workers, and creators. Our content and tools should attract, serve, and connect these individuals.

## 5. Strategic Pragmatism

As a small team, we must be ruthlessly efficient. We choose technology and workflows that maximize our velocity and minimize our overhead. We build what is necessary, measure its impact, and iterate quickly.
